            <h1>Bio:</h1>
            <p>My name is Erik Stone</p>
            <p>I am currently attending a coding camp sponsored by University of Oregon.</p>
            <p>I love puzzles and brainstorming, coming up with solutions and answers. I have found that I really enjoy
                learning, whether it is new techniques, methods, or new software.</p>
            <p>Hobbies: Home brewing, Boardgames, Writing Music, some Video games, Writing, Reading and soon I would
                like to make my own fermented foods (pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi)! I also hope to one day make my own video game, board game and or work on some of my favorite games.</p>
